# Exploring Wine Reviews

## Purpose
This repository does not accomplish a single goal; rather, it contains files I use to explore wine reviews in the purpose of practicing various visualization and machine learning methods.

## Data
The data contain roughly 150 thousand wine reviews that were scraped from WineEnthusiast. I did not gather these data myself; you may find the files freely available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews).
